# Restaurant Management
In this program, you can choose what you would like to order from a menu of food and drinks and can then calculate the total cost of your meal and save the receipt. Each user can view all of their previous receipts since different accounts can be created for each person
that they can log in and out of. There is also a calculator that can be used to determine the prices of meals as well.
